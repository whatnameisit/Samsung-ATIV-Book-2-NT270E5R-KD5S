# Samsung-ATIV-Book-2-NT270E5R-KD5S
macOS 10.14.3
## Issues
1. Too much noise picked up when Siri is active such that the A.I. sometimes thinks I'm still talking when I'm done. Need to reduce input level as low as possible. Or with the recent enough AppleALC.kext, The rude A.I. cuts input in the middle of my talk. Reducing the input level to about 10 % works OK.
2. Atheros WiFi/BT not suppored by Apple and AR9565 it not natively supported.
    - EMlyDinEsH is not working on BTFirmware anymore so Handoff and Air Drop are not working properly.
    - WiFi is very slow.
    - The card is soldered.
## Working
1. Things that are not listed in Issues
2. HDMI with sound and VGA (recognized as DP by macOS) work.
## Things to consider
1. fn key mapping,
2. The SD card reader cannot read any cards. This port (and also the bluetooth controller) is excluded from USB ports injection.
## Acknowledgment
